## üìä Project Workflow

The project follows a structured, multi-stage workflow designed to transform raw data into high-value business intelligence.

1. **Data Ingestion & Cleaning**: Load the raw CSV, handle missing values, correct data types, and perform initial quality assessment using Python.
2. **Database Normalization**: Deconstruct the flat file into a relational schema with four distinct tables (`customers`, `products`, `orders`, `sales`) to ensure data integrity and query efficiency.
3. **BigQuery Integration**: Upload the normalized tables to Google BigQuery to serve as the single source of truth for all subsequent analysis.
4. **Advanced SQL Analysis**: Execute over 20 complex SQL queries to perform cohort analysis, calculate RFM scores, and uncover deep business trends.
5. **Machine Learning Modeling**:
   - **Forecasting**: Develop three models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Prophet) to predict future sales.
   - **Segmentation**: Apply KMeans clustering to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.
6. **Insight Generation & Strategy**: Synthesize analytical findings into strategic business recommendations.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

The initial flat CSV was normalized into a relational star schema to improve query performance and maintain data integrity.

- **`customers` (Dimension)**: `customer_id` (PK), `customer_name`, `email`, `registration_date`
- **`products` (Dimension)**: `product_id` (PK), `product_name`, `category`, `list_price`
- **`orders` (Dimension)**: `order_id` (PK), `customer_id` (FK), `order_date`, `sales_rep`
- **`sales` (Fact)**: `invoice_number` (PK), `order_id` (FK), `product_id` (FK), `quantity`, `sales_amount`

ORDER BY list_price DESC;
```

## ü§ñ Machine Learning Models

### Sales Forecasting
Three different models were developed to forecast sales:

1. **Linear Regression (Baseline)**
   - **Performance**: R¬≤ = 0.72, RMSE = $1,247
   - **Purpose**: Establish performance baseline

2. **Random Forest (Advanced)**
   - **Performance**: R¬≤ = 0.87, RMSE = $892
   - **Purpose**: Capture non-linear relationships

3. **Facebook Prophet (Time-Series)**
   - **Performance**: 12-month forecast with seasonality
   - **Purpose**: Long-term forecasting with seasonal patterns

### Customer Segmentation
**KMeans Clustering** segmented customers into four personas:
- **VIP Customers** (12%): High-value, frequent buyers
- **Loyal Customers** (45%): Consistent, regular purchasers
- **At-Risk Customers** (23%): Haven't purchased recently
- **New/Budget Customers** (20%): Recent or infrequent buyers
