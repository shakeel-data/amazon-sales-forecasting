Amazon Sales Forecasting is crucial for accurately predicting future customer demand. This allows for optimized inventory management, preventing costly overstocking and lost sales from stockouts. As a result, businesses can significantly reduce waste, improve cash flow, and maximize profitability. Simultaneously, Customer Analytics uncovers distinct purchasing behaviors and segments the customer base. This enables highly targeted marketing campaigns and personalized experiences, boosting customer loyalty and satisfaction. Ultimately, this dual approach empowers data-driven strategic decisions that drive sustainable growth.

## BigQuery Integration
### Solution 1
**Set up GCP Credentials:**
Place your service account key `.json` file in the root directory and update the notebook code to reference its path.
```
from google.cloud import bigquery
import os

# 1. SETUP (Update these 2 lines with your info)
os.environ['GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS'] = 'your-json-file-path'
client = bigquery.Client(project='your-project-id')

# 2. SIMPLE FUNCTIONS
def create_dataset():
    dataset_id = 'your-dataset-id'
    try:
        client.get_dataset(dataset_id)
        print("Dataset exists")
    except:
        dataset = bigquery.Dataset(f"{client.project}.{dataset_id}")
        dataset.location = "US"
        client.create_dataset(dataset, exists_ok=True)
        print("Dataset created")

def upload_table(df, table_name):
    table_id = f"{client.project}.your-dataset-id.{table_name}"
    job_config = bigquery.LoadJobConfig(
        write_disposition="WRITE_TRUNCATE",
        autodetect=True
    )
    job = client.load_table_from_dataframe(df, table_id, job_config=job_config)
    job.result()
    print(f" {table_name}: {len(df)} rows uploaded")

# 3. RUN IT
print("Uploading to BigQuery...")

# Create dataset
create_dataset()

# Upload your 4 tables (these should already exist from your previous code)
upload_table(customers, 'customers')
upload_table(products, 'products') 
upload_table(orders, 'orders')
upload_table(sales, 'sales')

print("\n ALL DONE! Your tables are in BigQuery!")

# 4. TEST IT
test_query = """
SELECT COUNT(*) as customer_count 
FROM `your-project-id.your-dataset-id.customers`
"""

result = client.query(test_query).to_dataframe()
print(f"Test: Found {result.iloc[0]['customer_count']} customers")
```
### Solution 2
Upload the normalized 4 tables manually to Google BigQuery to serve as the single source of truth for all subsequent analysis
















## üìä Project Workflow

The project follows a structured, multi-stage workflow designed to transform raw data into high-value business intelligence.

1. **Data Ingestion & Cleaning**: Load the raw CSV, handle missing values, correct data types, and perform initial quality assessment using Python.
2. **Database Normalization**: Deconstruct the flat file into a relational schema with four distinct tables (`customers`, `products`, `orders`, `sales`) to ensure data integrity and query efficiency.
3. **BigQuery Integration**: Upload the normalized tables to Google BigQuery to serve as the single source of truth for all subsequent analysis.
4. **Advanced SQL Analysis**: Execute over 20 complex SQL queries to perform cohort analysis, calculate RFM scores, and uncover deep business trends.
5. **Machine Learning Modeling**:
   - **Forecasting**: Develop three models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Prophet) to predict future sales.
   - **Segmentation**: Apply KMeans clustering to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.
6. **Insight Generation & Strategy**: Synthesize analytical findings into strategic business recommendations.

## ‚öôÔ∏è SQL Analysis Showcase

This project features over 20 advanced SQL queries. 
Below are key highlights:
### Customer Overview
**Purpose: Basic customer information with aggregated metrics**
```sql
SELECT 
    customer_name,
    email,
    phone,
    registration_date,
    -- Calculate days since registration
    DATE_DIFF(CURRENT_DATE(), registration_date, DAY) as days_as_customer
FROM `your-project-id.amazon_sales_analysis.customers`
ORDER BY registration_date DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Product Catalog Summary
**Purpose: Overview of products with pricing information**
```sql
SELECT 
    category,
    product_name,
    list_price,
    unit_measure,
    -- Price categories for analysis
    CASE 
        WHEN list_price < 50 THEN 'Budget'
        WHEN list_price BETWEEN 50 AND 200 THEN 'Mid-Range'
        WHEN list_price > 200 THEN 'Premium'
        ELSE 'Unknown'
    END as price_category
FROM `your-project-id.amazon_sales_analysis.products`
WHERE list_price IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY list_price DESC;
```

**Purpose: Track sales trends over time**
```sql
SELECT
  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM o.order_date) AS year,
  EXTRACT(MONTH FROM o.order_date) AS month,
  COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS total_orders,
  ROUND(SUM(s.sales_amount), 2) AS total_revenue,
  ROUND(AVG(s.sales_amount), 2) AS avg_order_value
FROM
  `your-project-id.amazon_sales_analysis.orders` AS o
  JOIN
  `your-project-id.amazon_sales_analysis.sales` AS s
  ON o.order_id = s.order_id
GROUP BY year, month
ORDER BY year DESC, month DESC;
```

## ü§ñ Machine Learning Models

### Sales Forecasting
Three different models were developed to forecast sales:

1. **Linear Regression (Baseline)**
   - **Performance**: R¬≤ = 0.72, RMSE = $1,247
   - **Purpose**: Establish performance baseline

2. **Random Forest (Advanced)**
   - **Performance**: R¬≤ = 0.87, RMSE = $892
   - **Purpose**: Capture non-linear relationships

3. **Facebook Prophet (Time-Series)**
   - **Performance**: 12-month forecast with seasonality
   - **Purpose**: Long-term forecasting with seasonal patterns

### Customer Segmentation
**KMeans Clustering** segmented customers into four personas:
- **VIP Customers** (12%): High-value, frequent buyers
- **Loyal Customers** (45%): Consistent, regular purchasers
- **At-Risk Customers** (23%): Haven't purchased recently
- **New/Budget Customers** (20%): Recent or infrequent buyers

## üîç Key Findings & Insights

### üìà Sales Performance
- **Revenue Growth**: Identified 15% YoY growth in food category sales
- **Seasonality**: Q4 shows 35% higher sales due to holiday shopping
- **Top Performers**: Premium organic products drive highest margins

### üë• Customer Segmentation
- **VIP Customers** (12%): High value, frequent purchasers - focus on retention
